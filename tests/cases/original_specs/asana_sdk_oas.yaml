    description: >-
      Asana's audit log is an immutable log of [important events](/docs/audit-log-events#supported-audit-log-events)
      in your organization's Asana instance.


      The audit log API allows you to monitor and act upon important security
      and compliance-related changes. Organizations might use this API endpoint to:


      * Set up proactive alerting with a Security Information and Event Management
      (SIEM) tool like [Splunk](https://asana.com/guide/help/api/splunk)

      * Conduct reactive investigations when a security incident takes place

      * Visualize key domain data in aggregate to identify security trends


      Note that since the API provides insight into what is happening in an Asana
      instance, the data is [read-only](/reference/getauditlogevents). That is, there
      are no "write" or "update" endpoints for audit log events.


      Only [Service Accounts](https://asana.com/guide/help/premium/service-accounts)
      in [Enterprise Domains](https://asana.com/enterprise) can access audit log API
      endpoints. Authentication with a Service Account's
      [personal access token](/docs/personal-access-token) is required.


      For a full list of
      supported events, see [supported AuditLogEvents](/docs/audit-log-events#supported-audit-log-events).
  - name: Batch API
    description: >-
      There are many cases where you want to accomplish a variety of work in
      the Asana API but want to minimize the number of HTTP requests you make.
      For example:


      * Modern browsers limit the number of requests that a single web page can
        make at once.
      * Mobile apps will use more battery life to keep the cellular radio on
        when making a series of requests.
      * There is an overhead cost to developing software that can make multiple
        requests in parallel.
      * Some cloud platforms handle parallelism poorly, or disallow it
        entirely.


      To make development easier in these use cases, Asana provides a **batch
      API** that enables developers to perform multiple “actions” by making
      only a single HTTP request.


      #### Making a batch request


      To make a batch request, send a `POST` request to `/batch`. Like other
      `POST` endpoints, the body should contain a `data` envelope. Inside this
      envelope should be a single `actions` field, containing a list of
      “action” objects.  Each action represents a standard request to an
      existing endpoint in the Asana API.


      **The maximum number of actions allowed in a single batch request is 10**.
      Making a batch request with no actions in it will result in a `400 Bad
      Request`.


      When the batch API receives the list of actions to execute, it will
      dispatch those actions to the already-implemented endpoints specified by
      the `relative_path` and `method` for each action. This happens in
      parallel, so all actions in the request will be processed simultaneously.
      There is no guarantee of the execution order for these actions, nor is
      there a way to use the output of one action as the input of another
      action (such as creating a task and then commenting on it).


      The response to the batch request will contain (within the `data`
      envelope) a list of result objects, one for each action. The results are
      guaranteed to be in the same order as the actions in the request (e.g.,
      the first result in the response corresponds to the first action in the
      request)


      The batch API will always attempt to return a `200 Success` response with
      individual result objects for each individual action in the request. Only
      in certain cases (such as missing authorization or malformed JSON in the
      body) will the entire request fail with another status code. Even if
      every individual action in the request fails, the batch API will still
      return a `200 Success` response, and each result object in the response
      will contain the errors encountered with each action.


      #### Rate limiting


      The batch API fully respects all of our rate limiting. This means that a
      batch request counts against *both* the standard rate limiter and the
      concurrent request limiter as though you had made a separate HTTP request
      for every individual action. For example, a batch request with five
      actions counts as five separate requests in the standard rate limiter,
      and counts as five concurrent requests in the concurrent request limiter.
      The batch request itself incurs no cost.


      If any of the actions in a batch request would exceed any of the enforced
      limits, the *entire* request will fail with a `429 Too Many Requests`
      error. This is to prevent the unpredictability of which actions might
      succeed if not all of them could succeed.


      #### Restrictions


      Not every endpoint can be accessed through the batch API.
      Specifically, the following actions cannot be taken and will result in a
      `400 Bad Request` for that action:


      * Uploading attachments

      * Creating, getting, or deleting organization exports

      * Any SCIM operations

      * Nested calls to the batch API
  - name: Custom fields
    description: >-
      _Note: Custom fields are a premium feature. Integrations which work
      with custom fields need to handle an assortment of use cases for free and
      premium users in context of free and premium organizations. For a detailed
      examination of which data users will have access in different
      circumstances, review the section below on access control._


      In the Asana application, tasks, projects, and portfolios can hold
      user-specified [custom fields](https://asana.com/guide/help/premium/custom-fields)
      which provide extra information (e.g., a "priority" property with an associated
      value, or a number representing the time required to complete a task). This
      lets
      a user define the type of information that each item within a project or portfolio
      can contain in addition to the built-in fields that Asana provides.

      `display_value` is a read-only field that will always be a string. For apps
      that use custom fields, this is a great way to safely display/export the
      value of a custom field, regardless of its type. We suggest apps use
      this field in order to future-proof for changes to custom fields.


      #### Characteristics of custom fields


      * There is metadata that defines the custom field. This metadata can be
      shared across an entire workspace, or be specific to a project or portfolio.

      * Creating a custom field setting on a project or portfolio means each direct
      child will have the custom field. This is conceptually akin to adding
      columns in a database or a spreadsheet:
      every task (row) in the project (table) can contain information for that
      field, including "blank" values (i.e., `null` data). For portfolio custom
      fields, every project (row) in the portfolio (table) will contain
      information for the custom field.

      * Custom field settings only go one child deep. This means that a custom field
      setting on a portfolio will give each project the custom field, but not
      each task within those projects.

      * Tasks have custom field _values_ assigned to them.


      #### Types of custom fields


      Integrations using custom fields need to be aware of the six basic types that
      a custom field can adopt. These types are:


      * `text` - an arbitrary, relatively short string of text

      * `number` - a number with a defined level of precision

      * `enum` - a selection of a single option from a defined list of options (i.e.,
      mutually exclusive selections)

      * `multi_enum` - a selection of one or more options from a defined list of options
      (i.e., mutually inclusive selections)

      * `date` - a reference date with an optional time value

      * `people` - a list of active contributors (i.e., where their relationship to
      the work is defined in the custom field title)


      #### Example use case


      Consider an organization that has defined a custom field for "Priority".
      This field is of `enum` type and can have user-defined values of
      `Low`, `Medium`, or `High`. This is the field metadata, and it is
      visible within, and shared across, the entire organization.


      A project is then created in the organization, called "Bugs", and the
      "Priority" custom field is associated with that project. This will allow
      all tasks within the "Bugs" project to have an associated "Priority".


      A new task is created within "Bugs". This task, then, has a field named
      "Priority" which can take on the custom field value of one of `[null]`,
      `Low`, `Medium`, and `High`.


      #### Custom fields in the API


      These custom fields are accessible via the API through a number of
      endpoints at the top level (e.g. `/custom_fields` and
      `/custom_field_settings`) and through requests on workspaces, portfolios,
      projects, and tasks resources. The API also provides a way to fetch both the
      metadata and data which define each particular custom field, so that a client
      application may render proper UI to display or edit the values.


      Text fields are currently limited to 1024 characters. On tasks, their
      custom field value will have a `text_value` property to represent this
      field.


      Number fields can have an arbitrary `precision` associated with them; for
      example, a precision of `2` would round its value to the second
      (hundredths) place (e.g., `1.2345` would round to `1.23`). On tasks, the custom
      field value will have a `number_value` property to represent this field.


      #### Enum fields


      Enum fields represent a selection from a list of options. On the metadata,
      they will contain all of the options in an array. Each option has 4
      properties:


      * `gid` - the GID of this enum option. Note that this is the GID of the individual
      _option_. The custom field itself has a separate `gid`.

      * `name` - the name of the option (e.g., "Choice #1")

      * `enabled` - whether this field is enabled. Disabled fields are not
      available to choose from when disabled, and are visually hidden in the
      Asana application, but they remain in the metadata for custom field values
      which were set to the option before the option was disabled.

      * `color` - a color associated with this choice.


      On the task's custom field value, the enum will have an `enum_value`
      property which will be the same as one of the choices from the list
      defined in the custom field metadata.


      #### Querying an organization for its custom fields


      For custom fields shared across the workspace or organization, the
      workspace [can be queried](/reference/getcustomfieldsforworkspace)
      for its list of defined custom fields. Like other collection queries, the
      fields will be returned as a compact record; slightly different from most
      other compact records is the fact that the compact record for custom fields
      includes `type` as well as `gid` and `name`.


      #### Accessing custom field definitions


      The [custom fields](/reference/getcustomfield) reference
      describes how the metadata which defines a custom field is accessed. A
      GET request with a `gid` can be issued on the `/custom_fields` endpoint
      to fetch the full definition of a single custom field given its `gid`
      from (for instance) listing all custom fields on a workspace, or getting
      the `gid` from a custom field settings object or a task.


      #### Associating custom fields with a project or portfolio


      A mapping between a custom field and a project or portfolio is handled with
      a
      [custom field settings](/reference/custom-field-settings) object. This object
      contains a reference for each
      of the custom fields and the project or portfolio, as well as additional information
      about the status of that particular custom field (e.g., `is_important`, which
      defines
      whether or not the custom field will appear in the list/grid on the Asana application).


      #### Accessing custom field values on tasks or projects


      The [tasks](/reference/gettask) reference has information on how custom fields
      look on tasks. custom fields will return as an array on the
      property `custom_fields`, and each entry will contain, side-by-side, the
      compact representation of the custom field metadata and a
      `{typename}_value` property that stores the value set for the
      custom field.


      Of particular note is that the top-level `gid` of each entry in the
      `custom_fields` array is the `gid` of the custom field metadata, as it is
      the compact representation of this metadata. This can be used to refer to
      the full metadata by making a request to the
      `/custom_fields/{custom_fields_id}` endpoint as described above.


      Custom fields can be set just as in the Asana-defined fields on a task via
      `POST` or `PUT` requests. You can see an example in the
      [update a task](/reference/updatetask) endpoint.


      Custom fields on projects follow this same pattern.


      #### Warning: Program defensively with regards to custom field definitions


      Asana application users have the ability to change the definitions of
      custom field metadata. This means that as you write scripts or
      applications to work with them, it is possible for the definitions to
      change at any time, which may cause an application using them to break or
      malfunction if it makes assumptions about the metadata for a particular
      custom field. When using custom fields, it is a good idea to program
      *defensively*, meaning you your application should double-check that
      the custom field metadata are what it expects.


      Storing the state of the custom field metadata for too long if you
      dynamically create a model for it can cause your model to become
      out of sync with the model stored in Asana. For example, if you encounter
      an `enum` value on a task that does not match any option
      in your metadata model, your metadata model has become out of date with
      the custom field metadata.


      #### Enabled and disabled values


      When information that is contained in a custom field value loses a
      logical association with its metadata definition, the value becomes
      disabled. This can happen in a couple of simple ways, for example, if
      you remove the custom field metadata from a project, or move a task with
      a custom field to a different project which does not have the custom
      field metadata associated with it. The value remains on the task, and
      the custom field metadata can still be found and examined, but as the
      context in which the custom field makes sense is gone, the custom field
      cannot change its value; it can only be cleared.


      _Note: Tasks that are associated with multiple projects do not become
      disabled, so long as at least one of the projects is still associated
      with the custom field metadata. In other words, tasks with multiple
      projects will retain logically associated to the set of custom field
      metadata represented by all of their projects._


      Moving the task back under a project with that custom field applied to it
      or applying the custom field metadata to the current project will return
      the custom field value to an enabled state. In this scenario, the custom
      field will be re-enabled and editable again.


      In the Asana application, disabled fields are grayed out and not allowed
      to change, other than to be discarded. In the API, we return a property
      `enabled: false` to inform the external application that the value has
      been disabled.


      Note that the API enforces the same operations on disabled custom field
      values as hold in the Asana application: they may not have their values
      changed, since the lack of context for the values of a custom field in
      general doesn't provide enough information to know what new values should
      be. Setting the custom field value to `null` will clear and remove the
      custom field value from the task.


      #### Custom field access control


      Custom fields are a complex feature of the Asana platform, and their
      access in the Asana application and in the API vary based on the status
      of the user and project. When building your application, it is best to be
      defensive and not assume the given user will have read or write access
      to a custom field, and fail gracefully when this occurs.
  - name: Custom field settings
    description: >-
      Custom fields are attached to a particular project with the custom
      field settings resource. This resource both represents the
      many-to-many join of the custom field and project as well as stores
      information that is relevant to that particular pairing. For instance,
      the `is_important` property determines some possible
      application-specific handling of that custom field.
  - name: Events
    description: >-
      An event is an object representing a change to a resource that was
      observed by an event subscription. Event streams rely on the same infrastructure
      as webhooks, which ensures events are delivered within a minute (on average).
      This
      system is designed for at most once delivery, meaning in exceptional circumstances
      a small number of events may be missing from the stream. For this reason, if
      your use
      case requires strong guarantees about processing all changes on a resource and
      cannot
      tolerate any missing events, regardless of how rare that might be, we recommend
      building
      a fallback polling system that fetches the resource periodically as well. Note
      that while
      webhooks cannot be replayed once delivered, events are retrievable from the
      event stream
      for 24 hours after being processed.


      In general, requesting events on a resource is faster and subject to
      higher rate limits than requesting the resource itself. Additionally,
      change events "bubble up" (e.g., listening to events on a project would include
      when stories are added to tasks in the project, and even to subtasks).


      Establish an initial sync token by making a request with no sync token.
      The response will be a `412 Precondition Failed` error - the same as if
      the sync token had expired.


      Subsequent requests should always provide the sync token from the
      immediately preceding call.


      Sync tokens may not be valid if you attempt to go "backward" in the
      history by requesting previous tokens, though re-requesting the current
      sync token is generally safe, and will always return the same results.


      When you receive a `412 Precondition Failed` error, it means that the
      sync token is either invalid or expired. If you are attempting to keep a
      set of data in sync, this signals you may need to re-crawl the data.


      Sync tokens always expire after 24 hours, but may expire sooner,
      depending on load on the service.
  - name: Goals
    description: >-
      A goal is an object in the goal-tracking system that helps your organization
      drive measurable results.
  - name: Goal relationships
    description: >-
      A goal relationship is an object representing the relationship between a goal
      and another goal, a project, a task, or a portfolio.
  - name: Jobs
    description: >-
      Jobs represent processes that handle asynchronous work. A job created when an
      endpoint requests an action
      that will be handled asynchronously, such as project or task duplication.


      Only the creator of the duplication process can access the duplication
      status of the new object.


      *Note*: With any work that is handled asynchronously
      (e.g., [project instantation from a template](/reference/instantiateproject),
      duplicating a [task](/reference/duplicatetask) or [project](/reference/duplicateproject),
      etc.),
      the *intermittent states* of newly-created objects may not be consistent. That
      is, object properties may
      return different values each time when polled until the job `status` has returned
      a `succeeded` value.
  - name: Organization exports
    description: >-
      An `organization_export` object represents a request to export the
      complete data of an organization in JSON format.


      To export an organization using this API:


      * Create an `organization_export`
        [request](/reference/createorganizationexport)
        and store the ID that is returned.
      * Request the `organization_export` every few minutes, until the
        `state` field contains ‘finished’.
      * Download the file located at the URL in the `download_url` field.
      * Exports can take a long time, from several minutes to a few hours
        for large organizations.


      *Note: These endpoints are only available to [Service
      Accounts](https://asana.com/guide/help/premium/service-accounts) of an
      [Enterprise](https://asana.com/enterprise) organization.*
  - name: Portfolios
    description: >-
      A portfolio gives a high-level overview of the status of multiple
      initiatives in Asana. Portfolios provide a dashboard overview of the
      state of multiple projects, including a progress report and the most
      recent [status update](/reference/status-updates).

      Portfolios have some restrictions on size. Each portfolio has a max of 500
      items and, like projects, a maximum of 20 custom fields.
  - name: Portfolio memberships
    description: >-
      This object determines if a user is a member of a portfolio.
  - name: Projects
    description: >-
      A project represents a prioritized list of tasks in Asana or a board
      with columns of tasks represented as cards. A project exists in a single
      workspace or organization and is accessible to a subset of users in that
      workspace or organization, depending on its permissions.


      Projects in organizations are shared with a single team. Currently, the team
      of a project cannot be changed via the API. Non-organization
      workspaces do not have teams and so you should not specify the team of
      project in a regular workspace.


      Followers of a project are a subset of the members of that project.
      Followers of a project will receive all updates including tasks
      created, added and removed from that project. Members of the project
      have access to and will receive status updates of the project. Adding
      followers to a project will add them as members if they are not
      already, removing followers from a project will not affect membership.


      **Note:** You can use certain project endpoints to operate on
      [user task lists](/reference/user-task-lists) ([My Tasks](https://asana.com/guide/help/fundamentals/my-tasks))
      by substituting the `{project_gid}` with the `{user_task_list_gid}`. For example,
      you can perform

  - name: Project briefs
    description: >-
      A project brief object represents a rich text document that describes
      a project.


      Please note that this API is in *preview*, and is expected to change.
      This API is to be used for development and testing only as an advance
      view into the upcoming rich text format experience in the task description.
      For more information, see [this post](https://forum.asana.com/t/project-brief-api-now-available-as-a-preview/150885)

  - name: Project memberships
    description: >-
      With the introduction of “comment-only” projects in Asana, a user’s
      membership in a project comes with associated permissions. These
      permissions (i.e., whether a user has full access to the project or
      comment-only access) are accessible through the project memberships
      endpoints described here.
  - name: Project statuses
    description: |-
      *Deprecated: new integrations should prefer using [status updates](/reference/status-updates)*

      A project status is an update on the progress of a particular project,
      and is sent out to all project followers when created. These updates
      include both text describing the update and a color code intended to
      represent the overall state of the project: "green" for projects that
      are on track, "yellow" for projects at risk, "red" for projects that
      are behind, and "blue" for projects on hold.

      Project statuses can be created and deleted, but not modified.
  - name: Project templates
    description: |-
      A project template is an object that allows new projects to be created
      with a predefined setup, which may include tasks, sections, rules, etc.
      It simplifies the process of running a workflow that involves a similar
      set of work every time.


      Project templates in organizations are shared with a single team. Currently, the
      team of a project template cannot be changed via the API.
  - name: Sections
    description: >-
      A section is a subdivision of a project that groups tasks together.
      It can either be a header above a list of tasks in a list view or a
      column in a board view of a project.


      Sections are largely a shared idiom in Asana’s API for both list and
      board views of a project regardless of the project’s layout.


      The ‘memberships’ property when [getting a task](/reference/gettask)
      will return the information for the section or the column under
      ‘section’ in the response.
  - name: Status updates
    description: |-
      A status update is an update on the progress of a particular object,
      and is sent out to all followers when created. These updates
      include both text describing the update and a `status_type` intended to
      represent the overall state of the project. These include: `on_track` for projects that
      are on track, `at_risk` for projects at risk, `off_track` for projects that
      are behind, and `on_hold` for projects on hold.

      Status updates can be created and deleted, but not modified.
  - name: Stories
    description: >-
      *See [our forum post](https://forum.asana.com/t/no-more-parsing-story-text-new-fields-on-stories/42924)
      for more info on when conditional fields are returned.*


      A story represents an activity associated with an object in the
      Asana system. Stories are generated by the system whenever users take
      actions such as creating or assigning tasks, or moving tasks between
      projects. "Comments" are also a form of user-generated story.
  - name: Tags
    description: >-
      A tag is a label that can be attached to any task in Asana. It exists in
      a single workspace or organization.


      Tags have some metadata associated with them, but it is possible that
      we will simplify them in the future so it is not encouraged to rely
      too heavily on it. Unlike projects, tags do not provide any ordering
      on the tasks they are associated with.
  - name: Tasks
    description: >-
      The task is the basic object around which many operations in Asana are
      centered. In the Asana application, multiple tasks populate the
      middle pane according to some view parameters, and the set of selected
      tasks determines the more detailed information presented in the
      details pane.


      Sections are unique in that they will be included in the `memberships`
      field of task objects returned in the API when the task is within a
      section. They can also be used to manipulate the ordering of a task
      within a project.


      [Queries](/reference/gettasks)
      return a [compact representation of each task object](/reference/tasks). To
      retrieve *all* fields or *specific set* of the fields, use
      [field selectors](/docs/inputoutput-options) to manipulate what data is included
      in a response.
  - name: Task templates
    description: >-
      A task template is an object that allows new tasks to be created
      with a predefined setup, which may include followers, dependencies, custom fields,
      etc.
      It simplifies the process of running a workflow that involves a similar
      set of work every time.

      Task templates are contained within a single project.
  - name: Teams
    description: >-
      A team is used to group related projects and people together within an
      organization. Each project in an organization is associated with a team.
  - name: Team memberships
    description: >-
      This object determines if a user is a member of a team.
  - name: Time periods
    description: >-
      A time period is an object that represents a domain-scoped date range that can
      be set on [goals](/reference/goals).
  - name: Typeahead
    description: >-
      The typeahead search API provides search for objects from a single
      workspace.
  - name: Users
    description: >-
      A user object represents an account in Asana that can be given access to
      various workspaces, projects, and tasks.


      Like other objects in the system, users are referred to by numerical
      IDs. However, the special string identifier `me` can be used anywhere
      a user ID is accepted, to refer to the current authenticated user
      (e.g, `GET /users/me`).
  - name: User task lists
    description: >-
      A user task list represents the tasks assigned to a particular user.
      This list is the user's [My Tasks](https://asana.com/guide/help/fundamentals/my-tasks)
      list.
  - name: Webhooks
    description: >-
      Webhooks allow you to subscribe to notifications about events that occur on
      Asana resources (e.g., tasks, projects, stories, etc.).


      For a more detailed explanation of webhooks see the [overview of webhooks](/docs/webhooks-guide).
  - name: Workspaces
    description: >-
      A *workspace* is the highest-level organizational unit in Asana. All
      projects and tasks have an associated workspace.


      An *organization* is a special kind of workspace that represents a
      company. In an organization, you can group your projects into teams.
      You can read more about how organizations work on the Asana Guide. To
      tell if your workspace is an organization or not, check its
      `is_organization` property.


      Over time, we intend to migrate most workspaces into organizations and
      to release more organization-specific functionality. We may eventually
      deprecate using workspace-based APIs for organizations. Currently, and
      until after some reasonable grace period following any further
      announcements, you can still reference organizations in any
      `workspace` parameter.

        Offset token.

        An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request
        will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to
        the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return
        the first page of results.

        *Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a
        previously paginated request.*

        Sadly, sometimes requests to the API are not successful. Failures can
        occur for a wide range of reasons. In all cases, the API should return
        an HTTP Status Code that indicates the nature of the failure,
        with a response body in JSON format containing additional information.
        In the event of a server error the response body will contain an error
        phrase. These phrases are automatically generated using the
        [node-asana-phrase
        library](https://github.com/Asana/node-asana-phrase) and can be used by
        Asana support to quickly look up the incident that caused the server
        error.

              Enum options are the possible values which an enum custom field can
              adopt. An enum custom field must contain at least 1 enum option but
              no more than 500.


              You can add enum options to a custom field by using the `POST /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options`
              endpoint.


              **It is not possible to remove or delete an enum option**. Instead,
              enum options can be disabled by updating the `enabled` field to false
              with the `PUT /enum_options/enum_option_gid` endpoint. Other attributes
              can be updated similarly.


              On creation of an enum option, `enabled` is always set to `true`, meaning
              the enum option is a selectable value for the custom field. Setting
              `enabled=false` is equivalent to “trashing” the enum option in the Asana
              web app within the “Edit Fields” dialog. The enum option will no longer
              be selectable but, if the enum option value was previously set within
              a task, the task will retain the value.


              Enum options are an ordered list and by default new enum options are
              inserted at the end. Ordering in relation to existing enum options can
              be specified on creation by using `insert_before` or `insert_after`
              to reference an existing enum option. Only one of `insert_before` and
              `insert_after` can be provided when creating a new enum option.


              An enum options list can be reordered with the `POST /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options/insert`

            Only relevant for custom fields of type ‘Number’. This field
            dictates the number of places after the decimal to round to, i.e.
            0 is integer values, 1 rounds to the nearest tenth, and so on.
            Must be between 0 and 6, inclusive.

            For percentage format, this may be unintuitive, as a value of 0.25
            has a precision of 0, while a value of 0.251 has a precision of 1.
            This is due to 0.25 being displayed as 25%.

        Custom Fields store the metadata that is used in order to add user-specified
        information to tasks in Asana. Be sure to reference the [custom fields](/reference/custom-fields)
        developer documentation for more information about how custom fields relate
        to various resources in Asana.


        Users in Asana can [lock custom fields](https://asana.com/guide/help/premium/custom-fields#gl-lock-fields),
        which will make them read-only when accessed by other users. Attempting to
        edit a locked custom field will return HTTP error code `403 Forbidden`.

            This array specifies the possible values which an `enum` custom
            field can adopt. To modify the enum options, refer to [working
            with enum
            options](/reference/createenumoptionforcustomfield).

              A generic Asana Resource, containing a globally unique identifier.A
              generic Asana Resource, containing a globally unique identifier.

              Enum options are the possible values which an enum custom field can
              adopt. An enum custom field must contain at least 1 enum option but
              no more than 500.


              You can add enum options to a custom field by using the `POST /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options`
              endpoint.


              **It is not possible to remove or delete an enum option**. Instead,
              enum options can be disabled by updating the `enabled` field to false
              with the `PUT /enum_options/enum_option_gid` endpoint. Other attributes
              can be updated similarly.


              On creation of an enum option, `enabled` is always set to `true`, meaning
              the enum option is a selectable value for the custom field. Setting
              `enabled=false` is equivalent to “trashing” the enum option in the Asana
              web app within the “Edit Fields” dialog. The enum option will no longer
              be selectable but, if the enum option value was previously set within
              a task, the task will retain the value.


              Enum options are an ordered list and by default new enum options are
              inserted at the end. Ordering in relation to existing enum options can
              be specified on creation by using `insert_before` or `insert_after`
              to reference an existing enum option. Only one of `insert_before` and
              `insert_after` can be provided when creating a new enum option.


              An enum options list can be reordered with the `POST /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options/insert`
              endpoint.

            Enum options are the possible values which an enum custom field can adopt.
            An enum custom field must contain at least 1 enum option but no more than
            500.


            You can add enum options to a custom field by using the `POST /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options`
            endpoint.


            **It is not possible to remove or delete an enum option**. Instead, enum
            options can be disabled by updating the `enabled` field to false with
            the `PUT /enum_options/enum_option_gid` endpoint. Other attributes can
            be updated similarly.


            On creation of an enum option, `enabled` is always set to `true`, meaning
            the enum option is a selectable value for the custom field. Setting `enabled=false`
            is equivalent to “trashing” the enum option in the Asana web app within
            the “Edit Fields” dialog. The enum option will no longer be selectable
            but, if the enum option value was previously set within a task, the task
            will retain the value.


            Enum options are an ordered list and by default new enum options are inserted
            at the end. Ordering in relation to existing enum options can be specified
            on creation by using `insert_before` or `insert_after` to reference an
            existing enum option. Only one of `insert_before` and `insert_after` can
            be provided when creating a new enum option.

            500.


            You can add enum options to a custom field by using the `POST /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options`
            endpoint.


            **It is not possible to remove or delete an enum option**. Instead, enum
            options can be disabled by updating the `enabled` field to false with
            the `PUT /enum_options/enum_option_gid` endpoint. Other attributes can
            be updated similarly.


            On creation of an enum option, `enabled` is always set to `true`, meaning
            the enum option is a selectable value for the custom field. Setting `enabled=false`
            is equivalent to “trashing” the enum option in the Asana web app within
            the “Edit Fields” dialog. The enum option will no longer be selectable
            but, if the enum option value was previously set within a task, the task
            will retain the value.


            Enum options are an ordered list and by default new enum options are inserted
            at the end. Ordering in relation to existing enum options can be specified
            on creation by using `insert_before` or `insert_after` to reference an
            existing enum option. Only one of `insert_before` and `insert_after` can
            be provided when creating a new enum option.


            An enum options list can be reordered with the `POST /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options/insert`
            endpoint.

              Enum options are the possible values which an enum custom field can
              adopt. An enum custom field must contain at least 1 enum option but
              no more than 500.


              You can add enum options to a custom field by using the `POST /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options`
              endpoint.


              **It is not possible to remove or delete an enum option**. Instead,
              enum options can be disabled by updating the `enabled` field to false
              with the `PUT /enum_options/enum_option_gid` endpoint. Other attributes
              can be updated similarly.


              On creation of an enum option, `enabled` is always set to `true`, meaning
              the enum option is a selectable value for the custom field. Setting
              `enabled=false` is equivalent to “trashing” the enum option in the Asana
              web app within the “Edit Fields” dialog. The enum option will no longer
              be selectable but, if the enum option value was previously set within
              a task, the task will retain the value.


              Enum options are an ordered list and by default new enum options are
              inserted at the end. Ordering in relation to existing enum options can
              be specified on creation by using `insert_before` or `insert_after`
              to reference an existing enum option. Only one of `insert_before` and
              `insert_after` can be provided when creating a new enum option.

                This array specifies the possible values which an `enum` custom
                field can adopt. To modify the enum options, refer to [working

                  Enum options are the possible values which an enum custom field
                  can adopt. An enum custom field must contain at least 1 enum option
                  but no more than 500.


                  You can add enum options to a custom field by using the `POST /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options`
                  endpoint.


                  **It is not possible to remove or delete an enum option**. Instead,
                  enum options can be disabled by updating the `enabled` field to
                  false with the `PUT /enum_options/enum_option_gid` endpoint. Other
                  attributes can be updated similarly.


                  On creation of an enum option, `enabled` is always set to `true`,
                  meaning the enum option is a selectable value for the custom field.
                  Setting `enabled=false` is equivalent to “trashing” the enum option
                  in the Asana web app within the “Edit Fields” dialog. The enum option
                  will no longer be selectable but, if the enum option value was previously
                  set within a task, the task will retain the value.


                  Enum options are an ordered list and by default new enum options
                  are inserted at the end. Ordering in relation to existing enum options
                  can be specified on creation by using `insert_before` or `insert_after`
                  to reference an existing enum option. Only one of `insert_before`
                  and `insert_after` can be provided when creating a new enum option.


                  An enum options list can be reordered with the `POST /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options/insert`
                  endpoint.

        A generic Asana Resource, containing a globally unique identifier.A generic
        Asana Resource, containing a globally unique identifier.

        Enum options are the possible values which an enum custom field can adopt.
        An enum custom field must contain at least 1 enum option but no more than
        500.


        You can add enum options to a custom field by using the `POST /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options`
        endpoint.


        **It is not possible to remove or delete an enum option**. Instead, enum options
        can be disabled by updating the `enabled` field to false with the `PUT /enum_options/enum_option_gid`
        endpoint. Other attributes can be updated similarly.


        On creation of an enum option, `enabled` is always set to `true`, meaning
        the enum option is a selectable value for the custom field. Setting `enabled=false`
        is equivalent to “trashing” the enum option in the Asana web app within the
        “Edit Fields” dialog. The enum option will no longer be selectable but, if
        the enum option value was previously set within a task, the task will retain
        the value.


        Enum options are an ordered list and by default new enum options are inserted
        at the end. Ordering in relation to existing enum options can be specified
        on creation by using `insert_before` or `insert_after` to reference an existing
        enum option. Only one of `insert_before` and `insert_after` can be provided
        when creating a new enum option.


        An enum options list can be reordered with the `POST /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options/insert`
        endpoint.

        Asana Resource, containing a globally unique identifier.

        Enum options are the possible values which an enum custom field can adopt.
        An enum custom field must contain at least 1 enum option but no more than
        500.


        You can add enum options to a custom field by using the `POST /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options`
        endpoint.


        **It is not possible to remove or delete an enum option**. Instead, enum options
        can be disabled by updating the `enabled` field to false with the `PUT /enum_options/enum_option_gid`
        endpoint. Other attributes can be updated similarly.


        On creation of an enum option, `enabled` is always set to `true`, meaning
        the enum option is a selectable value for the custom field. Setting `enabled=false`
        is equivalent to “trashing” the enum option in the Asana web app within the
        “Edit Fields” dialog. The enum option will no longer be selectable but, if
        the enum option value was previously set within a task, the task will retain
        the value.


        Enum options are an ordered list and by default new enum options are inserted
        at the end. Ordering in relation to existing enum options can be specified
        on creation by using `insert_before` or `insert_after` to reference an existing
        enum option. Only one of `insert_before` and `insert_after` can be provided
        when creating a new enum option.


        An enum options list can be reordered with the `POST /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options/insert`
        endpoint.

        Sadly, sometimes requests to the API are not successful. Failures can

        In the event of a server error the response body will contain an error

    EventResponse:
      description: |-
        An *event* is an object representing a change to a resource that was
        observed by an event subscription or delivered asynchronously to
        the target location of an active webhook.

        The event may be triggered by a different `user` than the
        subscriber. For example, if user A subscribes to a task and user B
        modified it, the event’s user will be user B. Note: Some events
        are generated by the system, and will have `null` as the user. API
        consumers should make sure to handle this case.

        The `resource` that triggered the event may be different from the one
        that the events were requested for or the webhook is subscribed to. For
        example, a subscription to a project will contain events for tasks
        contained within the project.

        **Note:** pay close attention to the relationship between the fields
        `Event.action` and `Event.change.action`.
        `Event.action` represents the action taken on the resource
        itself, and `Event.change.action` represents how the information
        within the resource's fields have been modified.

        For instance, consider these scenarios:


        * When at task is added to a project, `Event.action` will be
        `added`, `Event.parent` will be an object with the `id` and
        `type` of the project, and there will be no `change` field.


        * When an assignee is set on the task, `Event.parent` will be
        `null`, `Event.action` will be `changed`,
        `Event.change.action` will be `changed`, and `new_value` will
        be an object with the user's `id` and `type`.


        * When a collaborator is added to the task, `Event.parent` will
        be `null`, `Event.action` will be `changed`,
        `Event.change.action` will be `added`, and `added_value` will be
        an object with the user's `id` and `type`.

                        generic Asana Resource, containing a globally unique identifier.

                        Enum options are the possible values which an enum custom
                        field can adopt. An enum custom field must contain at least
                        1 enum option but no more than 500.


                        You can add enum options to a custom field by using the `POST
                        /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options` endpoint.


                        **It is not possible to remove or delete an enum option**.
                        Instead, enum options can be disabled by updating the `enabled`
                        field to false with the `PUT /enum_options/enum_option_gid`
                        endpoint. Other attributes can be updated similarly.


                        On creation of an enum option, `enabled` is always set to
                        `true`, meaning the enum option is a selectable value for
                        the custom field. Setting `enabled=false` is equivalent to
                        “trashing” the enum option in the Asana web app within the
                        “Edit Fields” dialog. The enum option will no longer be selectable
                        but, if the enum option value was previously set within a
                        task, the task will retain the value.


                        Enum options are an ordered list and by default new enum options
                        are inserted at the end. Ordering in relation to existing
                        enum options can be specified on creation by using `insert_before`
                        or `insert_after` to reference an existing enum option. Only
                        one of `insert_before` and `insert_after` can be provided
                        when creating a new enum option.


                        An enum options list can be reordered with the `POST /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options/insert`
                        endpoint.

                      option but no more than 500.


                      You can add enum options to a custom field by using the `POST
                      /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options` endpoint.


                      **It is not possible to remove or delete an enum option**. Instead,
                      enum options can be disabled by updating the `enabled` field
                      to false with the `PUT /enum_options/enum_option_gid` endpoint.
                      Other attributes can be updated similarly.


                      On creation of an enum option, `enabled` is always set to `true`,
                      meaning the enum option is a selectable value for the custom
                      field. Setting `enabled=false` is equivalent to “trashing” the
                      enum option in the Asana web app within the “Edit Fields” dialog.
                      The enum option will no longer be selectable but, if the enum
                      option value was previously set within a task, the task will
                      retain the value.


                      Enum options are an ordered list and by default new enum options
                      are inserted at the end. Ordering in relation to existing enum
                      options can be specified on creation by using `insert_before`
                      or `insert_after` to reference an existing enum option. Only
                      one of `insert_before` and `insert_after` can be provided when
                      creating a new enum option.


                      An enum options list can be reordered with the `POST /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options/insert`
                      endpoint.

                      For percentage format, this may be unintuitive, as a value of
                      0.25

                      of 1.
                      This is due to 0.25 being displayed as 25%.

              Custom Fields store the metadata that is used in order to add user-specified
              information to tasks in Asana. Be sure to reference the [custom fields](/reference/custom-fields)
              developer documentation for more information about how custom fields
              relate to various resources in Asana.


              Users in Asana can [lock custom fields](https://asana.com/guide/help/premium/custom-fields#gl-lock-fields),
              which will make them read-only when accessed by other users. Attempting

                    generic Asana Resource, containing a globally unique identifier.

                    Enum options are the possible values which an enum custom field
                    can adopt. An enum custom field must contain at least 1 enum option
                    but no more than 500.


                    You can add enum options to a custom field by using the `POST
                    /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options` endpoint.


                    **It is not possible to remove or delete an enum option**. Instead,
                    enum options can be disabled by updating the `enabled` field to
                    false with the `PUT /enum_options/enum_option_gid` endpoint. Other

                  Enum options are the possible values which an enum custom field
                  can adopt. An enum custom field must contain at least 1 enum option
                  but no more than 500.

                  endpoint.


                  **It is not possible to remove or delete an enum option**. Instead,
                  enum options can be disabled by updating the `enabled` field to
                  false with the `PUT /enum_options/enum_option_gid` endpoint. Other
                  attributes can be updated similarly.

                      with enum
                      options](/reference/createenumoptionforcustomfield).

                        generic Asana Resource, containing a globally unique identifier.

                        Enum options are the possible values which an enum custom
                        field can adopt. An enum custom field must contain at least
                        1 enum option but no more than 500.


                        You can add enum options to a custom field by using the `POST
                        /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options` endpoint.


                        **It is not possible to remove or delete an enum option**.
                        Instead, enum options can be disabled by updating the `enabled`
                        field to false with the `PUT /enum_options/enum_option_gid`
                        endpoint. Other attributes can be updated similarly.


                        On creation of an enum option, `enabled` is always set to
                        `true`, meaning the enum option is a selectable value for
                        the custom field. Setting `enabled=false` is equivalent to
                        “trashing” the enum option in the Asana web app within the
                        “Edit Fields” dialog. The enum option will no longer be selectable
                        but, if the enum option value was previously set within a
                        task, the task will retain the value.


                        Enum options are an ordered list and by default new enum options
                        are inserted at the end. Ordering in relation to existing
                        enum options can be specified on creation by using `insert_before`
                        or `insert_after` to reference an existing enum option. Only
                        one of `insert_before` and `insert_after` can be provided
                        when creating a new enum option.


                        An enum options list can be reordered with the `POST /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options/insert`
                        endpoint.

                      Enum options are the possible values which an enum custom field
                      can adopt. An enum custom field must contain at least 1 enum
                      option but no more than 500.


                      You can add enum options to a custom field by using the `POST
                      /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options` endpoint.


                      **It is not possible to remove or delete an enum option**. Instead,
                      enum options can be disabled by updating the `enabled` field
                      to false with the `PUT /enum_options/enum_option_gid` endpoint.
                      Other attributes can be updated similarly.


                      On creation of an enum option, `enabled` is always set to `true`,
                      meaning the enum option is a selectable value for the custom
                      field. Setting `enabled=false` is equivalent to “trashing” the
                      enum option in the Asana web app within the “Edit Fields” dialog.
                      The enum option will no longer be selectable but, if the enum
                      option value was previously set within a task, the task will
                      retain the value.


                      Enum options are an ordered list and by default new enum options
                      are inserted at the end. Ordering in relation to existing enum
                      options can be specified on creation by using `insert_before`
                      or `insert_after` to reference an existing enum option. Only
                      one of `insert_before` and `insert_after` can be provided when
                      creating a new enum option.

                        generic Asana Resource, containing a globally unique identifier.

                        Enum options are the possible values which an enum custom
                        field can adopt. An enum custom field must contain at least
                        1 enum option but no more than 500.


                        You can add enum options to a custom field by using the `POST
                        /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options` endpoint.


                        **It is not possible to remove or delete an enum option**.
                        Instead, enum options can be disabled by updating the `enabled`
                        field to false with the `PUT /enum_options/enum_option_gid`
                        endpoint. Other attributes can be updated similarly.


                        On creation of an enum option, `enabled` is always set to
                        `true`, meaning the enum option is a selectable value for
                        the custom field. Setting `enabled=false` is equivalent to
                        “trashing” the enum option in the Asana web app within the
                        “Edit Fields” dialog. The enum option will no longer be selectable
                        but, if the enum option value was previously set within a
                        task, the task will retain the value.


                        Enum options are an ordered list and by default new enum options
                        are inserted at the end. Ordering in relation to existing
                        enum options can be specified on creation by using `insert_before`
                        or `insert_after` to reference an existing enum option. Only
                        one of `insert_before` and `insert_after` can be provided
                        when creating a new enum option.


                        An enum options list can be reordered with the `POST /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options/insert`
                        endpoint.

                        one of `insert_before` and `insert_after` can be provided
                        when creating a new enum option.


                        An enum options list can be reordered with the `POST /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options/insert`
                        endpoint.

                      Integrations that don't require the underlying type should

                      an app against new custom field types.

                      The description of the custom field.
                    type: string
                    example: Development team priority
                  precision:
                    description: >-
                      Only relevant for custom fields of type ‘Number’. This field
                      dictates the number of places after the decimal to round to,
                      i.e.
                      0 is integer values, 1 rounds to the nearest tenth, and so on.
                      Must be between 0 and 6, inclusive.

                      For percentage format, this may be unintuitive, as a value of
                      0.25
                      has a precision of 0, while a value of 0.251 has a precision
                      of 1.
                      This is due to 0.25 being displayed as 25%.

                      The identifier format will always have a precision of 0.
                    type: integer

                  precision:
                    description: >-
                      Only relevant for custom fields of type ‘Number’. This field
                      dictates the number of places after the decimal to round to,
                      i.e.
                      0 is integer values, 1 rounds to the nearest tenth, and so on.
                      Must be between 0 and 6, inclusive.

                      For percentage format, this may be unintuitive, as a value of
                      0.25
                      has a precision of 0, while a value of 0.251 has a precision
                      of 1.
                      This is due to 0.25 being displayed as 25%.

                      The identifier format will always have a precision of 0.

                        generic Asana Resource, containing a globally unique identifier.

                        Enum options are the possible values which an enum custom
                        field can adopt. An enum custom field must contain at least
                        1 enum option but no more than 500.


                        You can add enum options to a custom field by using the `POST
                        /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options` endpoint.


                        **It is not possible to remove or delete an enum option**.
                        Instead, enum options can be disabled by updating the `enabled`
                        field to false with the `PUT /enum_options/enum_option_gid`
                        endpoint. Other attributes can be updated similarly.


                        On creation of an enum option, `enabled` is always set to
                        `true`, meaning the enum option is a selectable value for
                        the custom field. Setting `enabled=false` is equivalent to
                        “trashing” the enum option in the Asana web app within the
                        “Edit Fields” dialog. The enum option will no longer be selectable
                        but, if the enum option value was previously set within a
                        task, the task will retain the value.


                        Enum options are an ordered list and by default new enum options
                        are inserted at the end. Ordering in relation to existing
                        enum options can be specified on creation by using `insert_before`
                        or `insert_after` to reference an existing enum option. Only
                        one of `insert_before` and `insert_after` can be provided
                        when creating a new enum option.


                        An enum options list can be reordered with the `POST /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options/insert`
                        endpoint.

                      Enum options are the possible values which an enum custom field
                      can adopt. An enum custom field must contain at least 1 enum
                      option but no more than 500.


                      You can add enum options to a custom field by using the `POST
                      /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options` endpoint.


                      **It is not possible to remove or delete an enum option**. Instead,
                      enum options can be disabled by updating the `enabled` field
                      to false with the `PUT /enum_options/enum_option_gid` endpoint.
                      Other attributes can be updated similarly.


                      On creation of an enum option, `enabled` is always set to `true`,
                      meaning the enum option is a selectable value for the custom
                      field. Setting `enabled=false` is equivalent to “trashing” the
                      enum option in the Asana web app within the “Edit Fields” dialog.
                      The enum option will no longer be selectable but, if the enum
                      option value was previously set within a task, the task will
                      retain the value.


                      Enum options are an ordered list and by default new enum options
                      are inserted at the end. Ordering in relation to existing enum
                      options can be specified on creation by using `insert_before`
                      or `insert_after` to reference an existing enum option. Only
                      one of `insert_before` and `insert_after` can be provided when
                      creating a new enum option.

                      The description of the custom field.
                    type: string
                    example: Development team priority
                  precision:
                    description: >-
                      Only relevant for custom fields of type ‘Number’. This field
                      dictates the number of places after the decimal to round to,
                      i.e.
                      0 is integer values, 1 rounds to the nearest tenth, and so on.
                      Must be between 0 and 6, inclusive.

                      For percentage format, this may be unintuitive, as a value of
                      0.25
                      has a precision of 0, while a value of 0.251 has a precision
                      of 1.
                      This is due to 0.25 being displayed as 25%.

                      The identifier format will always have a precision of 0.
                    type: integer

              Custom Fields store the metadata that is used in order to add user-specified
              information to tasks in Asana. Be sure to reference the [custom fields](/reference/custom-fields)
              developer documentation for more information about how custom fields
              relate to various resources in Asana.


              Users in Asana can [lock custom fields](https://asana.com/guide/help/premium/custom-fields#gl-lock-fields),
              which will make them read-only when accessed by other users. Attempting
              to edit a locked custom field will return HTTP error code `403 Forbidden`.

                    Enum options are the possible values which an enum custom field
                    can adopt. An enum custom field must contain at least 1 enum option
                    but no more than 500.


                    You can add enum options to a custom field by using the `POST
                    /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options` endpoint.


                    **It is not possible to remove or delete an enum option**. Instead,
                    enum options can be disabled by updating the `enabled` field to
                    false with the `PUT /enum_options/enum_option_gid` endpoint. Other
                    attributes can be updated similarly.


                    On creation of an enum option, `enabled` is always set to `true`,
                    meaning the enum option is a selectable value for the custom field.
                    Setting `enabled=false` is equivalent to “trashing” the enum option
                    in the Asana web app within the “Edit Fields” dialog. The enum
                    option will no longer be selectable but, if the enum option value
                    was previously set within a task, the task will retain the value.


                    Enum options are an ordered list and by default new enum options
                    are inserted at the end. Ordering in relation to existing enum
                    options can be specified on creation by using `insert_before`
                    or `insert_after` to reference an existing enum option. Only one
                    of `insert_before` and `insert_after` can be provided when creating
                    a new enum option.


                    An enum options list can be reordered with the `POST /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options/insert`
                    endpoint.

                  to reference an existing enum option. Only one of `insert_before`
                  and `insert_after` can be provided when creating a new enum option.


                  An enum options list can be reordered with the `POST /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options/insert`

                  Enum options are the possible values which an enum custom field
                  can adopt. An enum custom field must contain at least 1 enum option
                  but no more than 500.


                  You can add enum options to a custom field by using the `POST /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options`
                  endpoint.


                  **It is not possible to remove or delete an enum option**. Instead,
                  enum options can be disabled by updating the `enabled` field to
                  false with the `PUT /enum_options/enum_option_gid` endpoint. Other
                  attributes can be updated similarly.


                  On creation of an enum option, `enabled` is always set to `true`,
                  meaning the enum option is a selectable value for the custom field.
                  Setting `enabled=false` is equivalent to “trashing” the enum option
                  in the Asana web app within the “Edit Fields” dialog. The enum option
                  will no longer be selectable but, if the enum option value was previously
                  set within a task, the task will retain the value.


                  Enum options are an ordered list and by default new enum options
                  are inserted at the end. Ordering in relation to existing enum options
                  can be specified on creation by using `insert_before` or `insert_after`

            Custom Fields store the metadata that is used in order to add user-specified
            information to tasks in Asana. Be sure to reference the [custom fields](/reference/custom-fields)
            developer documentation for more information about how custom fields relate
            to various resources in Asana.


            Users in Asana can [lock custom fields](https://asana.com/guide/help/premium/custom-fields#gl-lock-fields),
            which will make them read-only when accessed by other users. Attempting
            to edit a locked custom field will return HTTP error code `403 Forbidden`.

                  Enum options are the possible values which an enum custom field
                  can adopt. An enum custom field must contain at least 1 enum option
                  but no more than 500.


                  You can add enum options to a custom field by using the `POST /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options`
                  endpoint.


                  **It is not possible to remove or delete an enum option**. Instead,
                  enum options can be disabled by updating the `enabled` field to
                  false with the `PUT /enum_options/enum_option_gid` endpoint. Other
                  attributes can be updated similarly.


                  On creation of an enum option, `enabled` is always set to `true`,
                  meaning the enum option is a selectable value for the custom field.
                  Setting `enabled=false` is equivalent to “trashing” the enum option
                  in the Asana web app within the “Edit Fields” dialog. The enum option
                  will no longer be selectable but, if the enum option value was previously
                  set within a task, the task will retain the value.


                  Enum options are an ordered list and by default new enum options
                  are inserted at the end. Ordering in relation to existing enum options
                  can be specified on creation by using `insert_before` or `insert_after`
                  to reference an existing enum option. Only one of `insert_before`
                  and `insert_after` can be provided when creating a new enum option.


                  An enum options list can be reordered with the `POST /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options/insert`
                  endpoint.

            Enum options are the possible values which an enum custom field can adopt.
            An enum custom field must contain at least 1 enum option but no more than
            500.


            You can add enum options to a custom field by using the `POST /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options`
            endpoint.


            **It is not possible to remove or delete an enum option**. Instead, enum
            options can be disabled by updating the `enabled` field to false with
            the `PUT /enum_options/enum_option_gid` endpoint. Other attributes can
            be updated similarly.


            On creation of an enum option, `enabled` is always set to `true`, meaning
            the enum option is a selectable value for the custom field. Setting `enabled=false`
            is equivalent to “trashing” the enum option in the Asana web app within
            the “Edit Fields” dialog. The enum option will no longer be selectable
            but, if the enum option value was previously set within a task, the task
            will retain the value.


            Enum options are an ordered list and by default new enum options are inserted
            at the end. Ordering in relation to existing enum options can be specified
            on creation by using `insert_before` or `insert_after` to reference an
            existing enum option. Only one of `insert_before` and `insert_after` can
            be provided when creating a new enum option.

              Enum options are an ordered list and by default new enum options are
              inserted at the end. Ordering in relation to existing enum options can
              be specified on creation by using `insert_before` or `insert_after`
              to reference an existing enum option. Only one of `insert_before` and
              `insert_after` can be provided when creating a new enum option.


              An enum options list can be reordered with the `POST /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options/insert`
              endpoint.

              Enum options are the possible values which an enum custom field can
              adopt. An enum custom field must contain at least 1 enum option but
              no more than 500.


              You can add enum options to a custom field by using the `POST /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options`
              endpoint.


              **It is not possible to remove or delete an enum option**. Instead,
              enum options can be disabled by updating the `enabled` field to false
              with the `PUT /enum_options/enum_option_gid` endpoint. Other attributes
              can be updated similarly.


              On creation of an enum option, `enabled` is always set to `true`, meaning
              the enum option is a selectable value for the custom field. Setting
              `enabled=false` is equivalent to “trashing” the enum option in the Asana
              web app within the “Edit Fields” dialog. The enum option will no longer
              be selectable but, if the enum option value was previously set within
              a task, the task will retain the value.


              Enum options are an ordered list and by default new enum options are
              inserted at the end. Ordering in relation to existing enum options can
              be specified on creation by using `insert_before` or `insert_after`

            The following conditions will change `modified_at`:

            - story is created on a task
            - story is trashed on a task
            - attachment is trashed on a task
            - task is assigned or unassigned
            - custom field value is changed

              Custom Fields store the metadata that is used in order to add user-specified
              information to tasks in Asana. Be sure to reference the [custom fields](/reference/custom-fields)
              developer documentation for more information about how custom fields
              relate to various resources in Asana.


              Users in Asana can [lock custom fields](https://asana.com/guide/help/premium/custom-fields#gl-lock-fields),
              which will make them read-only when accessed by other users. Attempting
              to edit a locked custom field will return HTTP error code `403 Forbidden`.

                    generic Asana Resource, containing a globally unique identifier.

                    Enum options are the possible values which an enum custom field
                    can adopt. An enum custom field must contain at least 1 enum option
                    but no more than 500.


                    You can add enum options to a custom field by using the `POST
                    /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options` endpoint.


                    **It is not possible to remove or delete an enum option**. Instead,
                    enum options can be disabled by updating the `enabled` field to
                    false with the `PUT /enum_options/enum_option_gid` endpoint. Other
                    attributes can be updated similarly.


                    On creation of an enum option, `enabled` is always set to `true`,
                    meaning the enum option is a selectable value for the custom field.
                    Setting `enabled=false` is equivalent to “trashing” the enum option
                    in the Asana web app within the “Edit Fields” dialog. The enum
                    option will no longer be selectable but, if the enum option value
                    was previously set within a task, the task will retain the value.


                    Enum options are an ordered list and by default new enum options
                    are inserted at the end. Ordering in relation to existing enum
                    options can be specified on creation by using `insert_before`
                    or `insert_after` to reference an existing enum option. Only one
                    of `insert_before` and `insert_after` can be provided when creating
                    a new enum option.


                    An enum options list can be reordered with the `POST /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options/insert`
                    endpoint.

                      Custom Fields store the metadata that is used in order to add
                      user-specified information to tasks in Asana. Be sure to reference
                      the [custom fields](/reference/custom-fields) developer documentation

                      which will make them read-only when accessed by other users.
                      Attempting to edit a locked custom field will return HTTP error

                          options](/reference/createenumoptionforcustomfield).

                            unique identifier.

                            Enum options are the possible values which an enum custom
                            field can adopt. An enum custom field must contain at
                            least 1 enum option but no more than 500.


                            You can add enum options to a custom field by using the
                            `POST /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options` endpoint.


                            **It is not possible to remove or delete an enum option**.
                            Instead, enum options can be disabled by updating the
                            `enabled` field to false with the `PUT /enum_options/enum_option_gid`
                            endpoint. Other attributes can be updated similarly.


                            On creation of an enum option, `enabled` is always set
                            to `true`, meaning the enum option is a selectable value
                            for the custom field. Setting `enabled=false` is equivalent
                            to “trashing” the enum option in the Asana web app within
                            the “Edit Fields” dialog. The enum option will no longer
                            be selectable but, if the enum option value was previously
                            set within a task, the task will retain the value.


                            Enum options are an ordered list and by default new enum
                            options are inserted at the end. Ordering in relation
                            to existing enum options can be specified on creation
                            by using `insert_before` or `insert_after` to reference
                            an existing enum option. Only one of `insert_before` and
                            `insert_after` can be provided when creating a new enum
                            option.


                            An enum options list can be reordered with the `POST /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options/insert`
                            endpoint.

                          be selectable but, if the enum option value was previously
                          set within a task, the task will retain the value.


                          Enum options are an ordered list and by default new enum
                          options are inserted at the end. Ordering in relation to
                          existing enum options can be specified on creation by using
                          `insert_before` or `insert_after` to reference an existing
                          enum option. Only one of `insert_before` and `insert_after`
                          can be provided when creating a new enum option.


                          An enum options list can be reordered with the `POST /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options/insert`
                          endpoint.A generic Asana Resource, containing a globally

                          globally unique identifier.

                          Enum options are the possible values which an enum custom
                          field can adopt. An enum custom field must contain at least
                          1 enum option but no more than 500.


                          You can add enum options to a custom field by using the
                          `POST /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options` endpoint.


                          **It is not possible to remove or delete an enum option**.
                          Instead, enum options can be disabled by updating the `enabled`
                          field to false with the `PUT /enum_options/enum_option_gid`
                          endpoint. Other attributes can be updated similarly.


                          On creation of an enum option, `enabled` is always set to
                          `true`, meaning the enum option is a selectable value for
                          the custom field. Setting `enabled=false` is equivalent
                          to “trashing” the enum option in the Asana web app within
                          the “Edit Fields” dialog. The enum option will no longer
                          be selectable but, if the enum option value was previously

            The external field allows you to store app-specific metadata on
            tasks, including a gid that can be used to retrieve tasks and a
            data blob that can store app-specific character strings. Note that
            you will need to authenticate with Oauth to access or modify this
            data. Once an external gid is set, you can use the notation
            `external:custom_gid` to reference your object anywhere in the API
            where you may use the original object gid. See the page on Custom
            External Data for more details.

              Custom Fields store the metadata that is used in order to add user-specified
              information to tasks in Asana. Be sure to reference the [custom fields](/reference/custom-fields)
              developer documentation for more information about how custom fields
              relate to various resources in Asana.


              Users in Asana can [lock custom fields](https://asana.com/guide/help/premium/custom-fields#gl-lock-fields),
              which will make them read-only when accessed by other users. Attempting
              to edit a locked custom field will return HTTP error code `403 Forbidden`.

                    Enum options are the possible values which an enum custom field
                    can adopt. An enum custom field must contain at least 1 enum option
                    but no more than 500.


                    You can add enum options to a custom field by using the `POST
                    /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options` endpoint.


                    **It is not possible to remove or delete an enum option**. Instead,
                    enum options can be disabled by updating the `enabled` field to
                    false with the `PUT /enum_options/enum_option_gid` endpoint. Other
                    attributes can be updated similarly.


                    On creation of an enum option, `enabled` is always set to `true`,
                    meaning the enum option is a selectable value for the custom field.
                    Setting `enabled=false` is equivalent to “trashing” the enum option
                    in the Asana web app within the “Edit Fields” dialog. The enum
                    option will no longer be selectable but, if the enum option value
                    was previously set within a task, the task will retain the value.


                    Enum options are an ordered list and by default new enum options
                    are inserted at the end. Ordering in relation to existing enum
                    options can be specified on creation by using `insert_before`
                    or `insert_after` to reference an existing enum option. Only one
                    of `insert_before` and `insert_after` can be provided when creating
                    a new enum option.


                    An enum options list can be reordered with the `POST /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options/insert`
                    endpoint.

                    was previously set within a task, the task will retain the value.


                    Enum options are an ordered list and by default new enum options
                    are inserted at the end. Ordering in relation to existing enum
                    options can be specified on creation by using `insert_before`
                    or `insert_after` to reference an existing enum option. Only one
                    of `insert_before` and `insert_after` can be provided when creating
                    a new enum option.


                    An enum options list can be reordered with the `POST /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options/insert`
                    endpoint.

                  Must be between 0 and 6, inclusive.

                  For percentage format, this may be unintuitive, as a value of 0.25
                  has a precision of 0, while a value of 0.251 has a precision of
                  1.
                  This is due to 0.25 being displayed as 25%.

      summary: Get attachments from an object

        Returns the compact records for all attachments on the object.


        There are three possible `parent` values for this request: `project`, `project_brief`,
        and `task`.
        For a project, an attachment refers to a file uploaded to the "Key resources"
        section in the project
        Overview. For a project brief, an attachment refers to inline files in the
        project brief itself. For
        a task, an attachment refers to a file directly associated to that task.


        Note that within the Asana app, inline images in the task description do not
        appear in the index of image
        thumbnails nor as stories in the task. However, requests made to `GET /attachments`
        for a task will return
        all of the images in the task, including inline images.

        Upload an attachment.

        This method uploads an attachment on an object and returns the compact
        record for the created attachment object. This is possible by either:

        - Providing the URL of the external resource being attached, or
        - Downloading the file content first and then uploading it as any other attachment. Note that it is not possible to attach
        files from third party services such as Dropbox, Box, Vimeo & Google Drive via the API

        The 100MB size limit on attachments in Asana is enforced on this endpoint.

        This endpoint expects a multipart/form-data encoded request containing the full contents of the file to be uploaded.

        Requests made should follow the HTTP/1.1 specification that line
        terminators are of the form `CRLF` or `\r\n` outlined
        [here](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/1.1/draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-01#Basic-Rules) in order for the server to reliably and properly handle the request.

      summary: Get audit log events
      description: >-
        Retrieve the audit log events that have been captured in your domain.


        This endpoint will return a list of [AuditLogEvent](/reference/audit-log-api)
        objects,
        sorted by creation time in ascending order. Note that the Audit Log API captures
        events
        from October 8th, 2021 and later. Queries for events before this date will
        not return
        results.


        There are a number of query parameters (below) that can be used to filter
        the set of
        [AuditLogEvent](/reference/audit-log-api) objects that are returned in the
        response. Any
        combination of query parameters is valid. When no filters are provided, all
        of the events
        that have been captured in your domain will match.


        The list of events will always be [paginated](/docs/pagination). The default
        limit
        is 1000 events. The next set of events can be retrieved using the `offset`
        from the
        previous response. If there are no events that match the provided filters
        in your domain, the endpoint will return `null` for the `next_page` field.
        Querying
        again with the same filters may return new events if they were captured after
        the
        last request. Once a response includes a `next_page` with an `offset`, subsequent
        requests can be made with the latest `offset` to poll for new events that
        match
        the provided filters.


        *Note: If the filters you provided match events in your domain and `next_page`
        is
        present in the response, we will continue to send `next_page` on subsequent
        requests
        even when there are no more events that match the filters. This was put in
        place so
        that you can implement an audit log stream that will return future events
        that match
        these filters. If you are not interested in future events that match the filters
        you
        have defined, you can rely on checking empty `data` response for the end of
        current
        events that match your filters.*


        When no `offset` is provided, the response will begin with the oldest events
        that match the provided filters. It is important to note that
        [AuditLogEvent](/reference/audit-log-api) objects will be permanently deleted
        from our systems
        after 90 days. If you wish to keep a permanent record of these events, we
        recommend using a
        SIEM tool to ingest and store these logs.

        Get the complete definition of a custom field’s metadata.

        Since custom fields can be defined for one of a number of types, and
        these types have different data and behaviors, there are fields that are
        relevant to a particular type. For instance, as noted above, enum_options
        is only relevant for the enum type and defines the set of choices that
        the enum could represent. The examples below show some of these
        type-specific custom field definitions.

      summary: Update a custom field
      description: >-
        A specific, existing custom field can be updated by making a PUT request
        on the URL for that custom field. Only the fields provided in the `data`
        block will be updated; any unspecified fields will remain unchanged

        When using this method, it is best to specify only those fields you wish
        to change, or else you may overwrite changes made by another user since
        you last retrieved the custom field.

        A custom field’s `type` cannot be updated.

        An enum custom field’s `enum_options` cannot be updated with this
        endpoint.
        Instead see “Work With Enum Options” for information on how to update
        `enum_options`.

        Locked custom fields can only be updated by the user who locked the field.

        Returns the complete updated custom field record.

        Asana limits a single sync token to 100 events. If more than 100 events exist
        for a given resource, `has_more: true` will be returned in the response, indicating

        event. This may be different from the one that the events were requested

        tasks contained within the project.*

            only get a list of portfolios that they themselves own, unless
            the request is made from a Service Account. In the case of a
            Service Account, if this parameter is specified, then all
            portfolios owned by this parameter are returned.
            Otherwise, all portfolios across the workspace are returned.

      summary: Create a portfolio
      description: |-
        Creates a new portfolio in the given workspace with the supplied name.

        Note that portfolios created in the Asana UI may have some state
        (like the “Priority” custom field) which is automatically added
        to the portfolio when it is created. Portfolios created via our
        API will *not* be created with the same initial state to allow
        integrations to create their own starting state on a portfolio.

        To form this request, it is recommended to first make a request to
        [get a project template](/reference/getprojecttemplate). Then, from the response,
        copy the
        `gid` from the object in the `requested_dates` array. This `gid` should be
        used in
        `requested_dates` to instantiate a project.


        _Note: The body of this request will differ if your workspace is an organization.
        To determine if your workspace is an organization, use the
        [is_organization](/reference/workspaces) parameter._

      summary: Create a project
      description: |-
        Create a new project in a workspace or team.

        Every project is required to be created in a specific workspace or
        organization, and this cannot be changed once set. Note that you can use
        the `workspace` parameter regardless of whether or not it is an
        organization.

        If the workspace for your project is an organization, you must also
        supply a `team` to share the project with.

        Returns the full record of the newly created project.

      summary: Update a project
      description: |-
        A specific, existing project can be updated by making a PUT request on
        the URL for that project. Only the fields provided in the `data` block
        will be updated; any unspecified fields will remain unchanged.

        When using this method, it is best to specify only those fields you wish
        to change, or else you may overwrite changes made by another user since
        you last retrieved the task.

        Returns the complete updated project record.

        You must
        [opt in](/docs/inputoutput-options) using `opt_fields` to get any information
        from this endpoint.


        This endpoint has an additional [rate limit](/docs/rate-limits) and each field
        counts especially high
        against our [cost limits](/docs/rate-limits#cost-limits).


        Milestones are just tasks, so they are included in the `num_tasks`, `num_incomplete_tasks`,

      summary: Add users to a project
      description: >-
        Adds the specified list of users as members of the project. Note that
        a user being added as a member may also be added as a *follower* as a
        result of this operation. This is because the user's default notification
        settings (i.e., in the "Notifcations" tab of "My Profile Settings") will
        override this endpoint's default behavior of setting "Tasks added"
        notifications to `false`.

        Returns the updated project record.

        notifications for a project. Therefore, if the users are not already
        members of the project, they will also become members as a result of
        this operation.

      summary: Create a task
      description: |-
        Creating a new task is as easy as POSTing to the `/tasks` endpoint with a
        data block containing the fields you’d like to set on the task. Any
        unspecified fields will take on default values.

        Every task is required to be created in a specific workspace, and this
        workspace cannot be changed once set. The workspace need not be set
        explicitly if you specify `projects` or a `parent` task instead.

          description: This endpoint returns a compact resource, which excludes some
            properties by default. To include those optional properties, set this
            query parameter to a comma-separated list of the properties you wish to
            include.

      summary: Update a task
      description: |-
        A specific, existing task can be updated by making a PUT request on the
        URL for that task. Only the fields provided in the `data` block will be
        updated; any unspecified fields will remain unchanged.

        When using this method, it is best to specify only those fields you wish
        to change, or else you may overwrite changes made by another user since
        you last retrieved the task.

        Returns the complete updated task record.

        *Note: Access control is enforced for this endpoint as with
        all Asana API endpoints, meaning a user’s private tasks will be
        filtered out if the API-authenticated user does not have access
        to them.*

        *Note: Both complete and incomplete tasks are returned by
        default unless they are filtered out (for example, setting
        `completed_since=now` will return only incomplete tasks, which
        is the default view for “My Tasks” in Asana.)*

        Adds the task to the specified project, in the optional location
        specified. If no location arguments are given, the task will be added to
        the end of the project.

        `addProject` can also be used to reorder a task within a project or
        section that already contains it.

        At most one of `insert_before`, `insert_after`, or `section` should be
        specified. Inserting into a section in an non-order-dependent way can be
        done by specifying section, otherwise, to insert within a section in a
        particular place, specify `insert_before` or `insert_after` and a task
        within the section to anchor the position of this task.

        A task can have at most 20 projects multi-homed to it.

        Returns an empty data block.

      summary: Search tasks in a workspace
      description: >-
        To mirror the functionality of the Asana web app's advanced search feature,
        the Asana API has a task search endpoint that allows you to build complex
        filters to find and retrieve the exact data you need.

        #### Premium access

        Like the Asana web product's advance search feature, this search endpoint
        will
        only be available to premium Asana users. A user is premium if any of the
        following is true:


        - The workspace in which the search is being performed is a premium workspace
        - The user is a member of a premium team inside the workspace


        Even if a user is only a member of a premium team inside a non-premium
        workspace, search will allow them to find data anywhere in the workspace,
        not just inside the premium team. Making a search request using credentials
        of a non-premium user will result in a `402 Payment Required` error.

        #### Pagination

        Search results are not stable; repeating the same query multiple times may
        return the data in a different order, even if the data do not change. Because
        of this, the traditional [pagination](https://developers.asana.com/docs/#pagination)
        available elsewhere in the Asana API is not available here. However, you can
        paginate manually by sorting the search results by their creation time and
        then
        modifying each subsequent query to exclude data you have already seen. Page
        sizes
        are limited to a maximum of 100 items, and can be specified by the `limit`
        query parameter.

        #### Eventual consistency

        Changes in Asana (regardless of whether they’re made though the web product
        or the API) are forwarded to our search infrastructure to be indexed. This
        process can take between 10 and 60 seconds to complete under normal operation,
        and longer during some production incidents. Making a change to a task that
        would alter its presence in a particular search query will not be reflected
        immediately. This is also true of the advanced search feature in the web product.

        #### Rate limits

        You may receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response if you hit any of our
        [rate limits](https://developers.asana.com/docs/#rate-limits).

        #### Custom field parameters

        | Parameter name | Custom field type | Accepted type |

        |---|---|---|

        | custom_fields.{gid}.is_set | All | Boolean |

        | custom_fields.{gid}.value | Text | String |

        | custom_fields.{gid}.value | Number | Number |

        | custom_fields.{gid}.value | Enum | Enum option ID |

        | custom_fields.{gid}.starts_with | Text only | String |

        | custom_fields.{gid}.ends_with | Text only | String |

        | custom_fields.{gid}.contains | Text only | String |

        | custom_fields.{gid}.less_than | Number only | Number |

        | custom_fields.{gid}.greater_than | Number only | Number |



        For example, if the gid of the custom field is 12345, these query parameter
        to
        find tasks where it is set would be `custom_fields.12345.is_set=true`. To
        match
        an exact value for an enum custom field, use the gid of the desired enum option
        and not the name of the enum option: `custom_fields.12345.value=67890`.


        **Not Supported**: searching for multiple exact matches of a custom field,
        searching for multi-enum custom field


        *Note: If you specify `projects.any` and `sections.any`, you will receive
        tasks for the project **and** tasks for the section. If you're looking for
        only tasks in a section, omit the `projects.any` from the request.*

        A specific, existing time tracking entry can be updated by making a `PUT` request on
        the URL for that time tracking entry. Only the fields provided in the `data` block
        will be updated; any unspecified fields will remain unchanged.

        When using this method, it is best to specify only those fields you wish
        to change, or else you may overwrite changes made by another user since
        you last retrieved the task.

        Returns the complete updated time tracking entry record.

        Retrieves objects in the workspace based via an auto-completion/typeahead
        search algorithm. This feature is meant to provide results quickly, so do
        not rely on this API to provide extremely accurate search results. The
        result set is limited to a single page of results with a maximum size, so
        you won’t be able to fetch large numbers of results.

        The typeahead search API provides search for objects from a single
        workspace. This endpoint should be used to query for objects when
        creating an auto-completion/typeahead search feature. This API is meant
        to provide results quickly and should not be relied upon for accurate or
        exhaustive search results. The results sets are limited in size and
        cannot be paginated.

        Queries return a compact representation of each object which is typically
        the gid and name fields. Interested in a specific set of fields or all of
        the fields?! Of course you are. Use field selectors to manipulate what
        data is included in a response.

        Resources with type `user` are returned in order of most contacted to
        least contacted. This is determined by task assignments, adding the user
        to projects, and adding the user as a follower to tasks, messages,
        etc.

        Resources with type `project` are returned in order of recency. This is
        determined when the user visits the project, is added to the project, and
        completes tasks in the project.

        Resources with type `task` are returned with priority placed on tasks
        the user is following, but no guarantee on the order of those tasks.

        Resources with type `project_template` are returned with priority
        placed on favorited project templates.

        Leaving the `query` string empty or omitted will give you results, still
        following the resource ordering above. This could be used to list users or
        projects that are relevant for the requesting user's api token.

        Establish a webhook
      description: |-
        Establishing a webhook is a two-part process. First, a simple HTTP POST
        request initiates the creation similar to creating any other resource.

        Next, in the middle of this request comes the confirmation handshake.
        When a webhook is created, we will send a test POST to the target with an
        `X-Hook-Secret` header. The target must respond with a `200 OK` or `204
        No Content` and a matching `X-Hook-Secret` header to confirm that this
        webhook subscription is indeed expected. We strongly recommend storing
        this secret to be used to verify future webhook event signatures.

        The POST request to create the webhook will then return with the status
        of the request. If you do not acknowledge the webhook’s confirmation
        handshake it will fail to setup, and you will receive an error in
        response to your attempt to create it. This means you need to be able to
        receive and complete the webhook *while* the POST request is in-flight
        (in other words, have a server that can handle requests asynchronously).

        Invalid hostnames like localhost will recieve a 403 Forbidden status code.
