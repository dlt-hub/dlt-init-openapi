dlt-openapi init braze --url https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dlt-hub/openapi-specs/main/open_api_specs/braze.yaml?token=GHSAT0AAAAAACGBVOHPQASWMN2OHDILCVTYZSHE4RA

my flow:
- i look at the files generated, looks like a lot, not sure what they all are, wondering if i need to do anything
- i look at main readme md line 11 resources, was expecting to see a list but i see only this one so i assume its gibberish "_GETÂ /campaigns/data_series_  "
- i look at pipeline and it looks like i can use this
- I ctrl-click on braze source and see the config/code
- i still wonder about the other files - i find the other readme and think maybe it's instructions, but it's not - it's docs
