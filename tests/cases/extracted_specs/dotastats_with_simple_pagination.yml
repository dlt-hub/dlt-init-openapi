    # Introduction

    The OpenDota API provides Dota 2 related data including advanced match data
    extracted from match replays.


    You can find data that can be used to convert hero and ability IDs and other
    information provided by the API from the
    [dotaconstants](https://github.com/odota/dotaconstants) repository.


    Without a key, you can make 2,000 free calls per day at a rate limit of 60
    requests/minute. We also offer a Premium Tier with unlimited API calls and
    higher rate limits. Check out the [API
    page](https://www.opendota.com/api-keys) to learn more.
